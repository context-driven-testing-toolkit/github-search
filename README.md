# Bash Shell Wrapper For Github Search

Allows you to retrieve all the search results for a search query
using Github API v4, their GraphQL API.

This script requires some custom `jq` functions. To enable them download this file and place it in your `$HOME` directory (so that its path is `~/.jq` ) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/context-driven-testing-toolkit/jq-stdlib/master/lib/jq/stdlib.jq
